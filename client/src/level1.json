     "infoText": "A link connects different web pages and may also contain malicious code. Usually, the hyperlink is highlighted/underlined. Links are a common method of redirecting users to a malicious website or loading malicious code onto their computers. Links do not have to represent the actual address and thus can look more valid than they are. If you move your mouse over the link (not click!) you can see the real address."

However, pay attention to the context: request + pressure, e.g. phrases like: 'You have 10 hours until we close your account' or even just 'react now' should set off alarm bells."
